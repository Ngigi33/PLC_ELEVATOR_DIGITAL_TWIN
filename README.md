# PLC Elevator Digital Twin 🚀
This project takes elevator control to the next level by fusing real-world engineering with digital simulation. Using advanced tools and custom hardware, we created a digital twin of an elevator system that’s as smooth as it is smart!

## Highlights 🛗
* Seamless Control: Managed by a Siemens S7-1200 PLC
* Interactive HMI: Designed using WinCC for an intuitive user experience
* Precision Motion: Leveraged PID control and the Sinamics G120 VFD for smooth, accurate motor operation
* Custom Hardware: A hand-crafted metal elevator model made in the workshop

## Software Used 🖥️
* TIA Portal: Centralized programming for PLC and HMI
* Step 7: PLC programming made easy
* Sinamics StartDrive: Fine-tuning the VFD for precise motor control
* WinCC: HMI design and monitoring
